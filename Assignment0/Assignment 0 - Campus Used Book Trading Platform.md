## 2. Project Background

​	Books play an indispensable role in the daily academic life of university students, whether they are textbooks, tools or literary works such as novels, which both increase their professional knowledge and enrich their spiritual world. However, there are several phenomena that currently prevent books from being used more effectively.

- Textbooks end up unused and discarded at the end of the course, etc

- Literature is put on the shelf after it has been read

- The price of many specialist books is prohibitive

  On the other hand

- Some bookshops sell second-hand books at too low a depreciation rate but at high prices, making a high price difference. Students are less willing to buy and sell.

- Some books and materials are less widely distributed and difficult to find outside of school.

- There is a lack of bridges between those who have unused books and those who have a need to buy them.

​	In order to make fuller and more efficient use of books and to allow students to get the books they want economically and quickly, it is necessary to create an open and inclusive sharing platform with a diversified focus on second-hand book trading.


## 3. Main objectives (project content)

- To develop a rational plan for the system and strengthen the ability to design and analyse the system by fully applying object-oriented, combined with what we have learned in the system analysis and design course

- To facilitate the trading of books and to provide a bridge between those who buy and those who sell books.
- Provide book donation services, temporarily store books donated by users to libraries or charity kiosks to avoid unreasonable waste of books.
- Cooperate with school authorities to provide book purchase recommendations for campus users according to the requirements of teachers of various courses.

## 5. Target users and usability goals

### Target users

- students who have a lot of unused textbooks at the end of the semester and have no way to dispose of them
- students who have spent too much money to buy textbooks at the beginning of the semester
- students who need a used book but can't find it in the market
Students who wish to donate books: contact the school library and the charity kiosk through the platform and keep the books in a safe place.

### Usability goals

- Compared with traditional bookstores, the process of earning price difference is reduced, so that students can get books at a lower price. 

- Compared to online book buying, on-campus book trading reduces the delivery process and is more convenient and fast
- The market is concentrated on campus, and the book inventory is more abundant and targeted


## 6. Analysis of existing similar products

Compared with Confucius Used Books, Used Books Street, etc., this platform has the following advantages

- The platform is more accurate in terms of groups and landing areas (students and schools), and the corresponding books are more abundant
- The transaction scope is concentrated in the school, which saves the seller shipping cost and the buyer can get the purchased books on the same day.
- Linkage with the school academic system, providing guidance for students' book purchases

## 7. Novelty of the solution

- The platform is open to all students and allows them to recommend books based on their training programme if their information is known
- A platform for buyers and sellers to communicate with each other, with buyers posting requests and buyers and sellers using search engines to get in touch quickly
- The books donated by students will be entered into a database, stored and made available free of charge to those who need them.

## 8. Possible challenges

- Many students' private data are stored in the user management system. The data viewing permissions of different roles should be reasonably planned and corresponding security control conditions should be added for the purpose of protecting personal privacy.
- Users should be strictly verified and investigated when registering in the system, and appropriate restrictions should be placed on the trading of user books so that people with an ulterior motive do not borrow the platform for improper profit.
- The collection of books stored in libraries and charity kiosks should be subject to formalities and restrictions so that they can be used to their full potential.
- Define system boundaries and adopt appropriate technology for project development.
- To be self-sufficient for long-term operation, how to better communicate with commercial advertising is an issue that will face future web development.
