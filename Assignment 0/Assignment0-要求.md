    - notes on existing similar products: their utility and limitations and/or advantages and disadvantages
    - novelty of your solution and/or enhancements suggested
    - potential for further development
    - challenges that you think you may encounter during the project’s development
    - related technologies (platform, languages, libraries, tools, etc.)
- A note on how this project can help your own professional growth (how you would benefit from it).
